    <h1 style="color:red;font-size:200%;text-align:center;">Interest In IT</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>What is your interest in IT</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I like to fix anything electronic mainly desktops, laptops, gaming consoles & mobiles</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Testing new products - new phones, new gaming consoles, new games, android boxes, android projectors, TVs etc</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">I like the fact i can research any topic with a simple click</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Interesting in learning different Computer system languages, for apps, websites, games etc </p>
<br> </br>
	<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>When did your interest in IT start</b> </h1>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Only 13 years ago, didn't have a clue what a file was. But honestly i wanted to download music & a movie, and that started me.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Trial & error for months, i slowly learnt different file formats, which then lead to the use of countless types of software.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">For 6 months i did this learning more and more. Which lead to hardware issues, opening up my laptop was nerve racking but so exciting</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">A few years later i opened up a small computer & console repair shop "Playtime Technology". Family issues forced me to close.</p>
<br> </br>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I figured I still have to work to pay the bills, so i thought part-time online studies would be appropriate for me.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Researched a bit online and came across Open university which lead me to RMIT.</p>
<br> </br>	
	<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>What do you expect to learn during you studies</b> </h1>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Coding, website building, AI related projects, in general stuff I haven't explored</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">I get stuck or fixated on 1 area, I thought this would give me a direction to learn different areas on a time-line</p>

    <h1 style="color:red;font-size:200%;text-align:center;">Ideal Job</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>I have 2 ideal jobs I'm undecided with</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">1st is to operate a small to medium franchise of computer/ gaming/ mobile repair stores, which would include a new age hub for</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">professional/ novice gamers to train & play.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">This is a few years off. But plan to open up in 3 locations in Melbourne, if successful i would like to operate in all major cities in Australia.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">My idea for the gamers hub is still in the making but money is the 1st issue, which leads to my 2nd ideal job.</p>
<br> </br>
	<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>2nd is a Testing analyst or test engineer</b> </h1>
	<p style="text-align:center;">Testing Software & Hardware in new gaming consoles.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">I like testing new products from a user perspective, ive always considered this as a role I'd enjoy.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">The skills i would need to gain would be C# & other high level programming, Embedded systems, database entries, Microsoft office, learning TRS & the testing process.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">As i don't have any formal skills i would need to learn C# to start, computer science & embedded systems.</p>
<br> </br>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>Plan</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">1st complete this course, not only to learn different ares of IT, but to also give me an idea what i do & don't like.</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">2nd complete indroduction to embedded systems</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">3rd complete all high level programming course</p>

<br> </br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>What do the results of the tests mean for you?</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Explains alot and with great detail. I'm very happy with my results, It's explains things i couldn't describe or understand. </p>
<br> </br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Not only did it explain my strengths but detailed my weakness. Working in a team, I'm not as open and vocal unless I'm leading,</p>
	<p style="text-align:center;">learning this has influenced & motivated myself to try & adapt in different team projects as a team member not as a leader. </p>
<br> </br>
<h1 style="text-align:center;"> <b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b> </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I randomly choose a team to replicate a workplace scenario, it give me a chance to work on my own flaws.</p>
